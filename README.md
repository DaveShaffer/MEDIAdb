# MEDIAdb
GA WDI Proj 2

It was fairly easy to organize record albums.  They are all the same size and are organized by alphabetically by artist.  If it was a sound track or compilation, it was filed under "various artists," then alphabetical by title.  Magazines are usually the same size and organized chronologically.  Books were usually divided by subject, then alphabetical by title.  Sometimes it is easier to sort them by size.  It became more complex when VHS came out.  Each tape contained a random mix of movies, TV shows, shorts, commercials and news reports.  The tapes were indexed chronologically and the contents were kept in a notebook.

With the introduction of new formats, CD, DVD and Blu-Ray, the problem got worse.  For awhile it was possible to keep the discs in albums sorted alphabetically.  As the number of discs and albums grew, complete resorts became impractical.

The idea behind MEDIAdb is to store any type of information medium as compactly as possible, leave them in whatever order they are already in, give each collection (book, magazine, DVD, tape, etc) an index number.  Then refer to the collections by their index and write the range of index numbers on the outside of the container holding the collections.  Any new additions to the containers are placed in the next available position, reguardless of the collections content.
